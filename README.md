# course_checker
A web-scraping program in Python that logs onto McGill's Minerva portal, and checks if a course you are interested in has room.
Loops until one spot opens.
Automatically sends you an email to notify you (need to setup an email class on the side).

Has been created for FINE 446 - Behavioral Finance, so make sure you make the right adjustments to your code before running it.
